Hello ALC and udacity
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to learn Front End web Development.
I have learnt HTML and css
Both languages look okay but they are abit challanging,I found CSS to be much more enjoyable since it was easy to grasp.
I still have some few problems with connectiong css to html Filter.
I could say that I have used Mock-up to article to solve the issues I was facing with HTML and css
